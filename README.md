# My Rebuild

## Overview
I've decided to recreate my personal project from the ground up in Rails 6. Due to my love of all things minimal, I've opted to leave the repository public. This will allow it to serve as both a learning resource for aspiring Ruby on Rails developers, and as a public project that I can point people to when they ask to see some code.

In the past most of my work has been restricted to private repositories because I don't like adding commercial assets to the .gitignore. This time, I'm building everything myself to ensure that the project can live in a public repository.

## Mission
The goal is to use this project to test the waters of Ruby on Rails 6. Through the use of previous Rails features, as well as the new Action Text, I hope to see how much can be accomplished and with how little code it can be done. That said, clarity will be king. If I feel as though code could be clearer if it's executed in multiple steps, I will try to take the more verbose route.

## Setup
If you're interested in setting up the project yourself, right now the only things you have to do is download the project and run the migrations from within the directory. (Make sure you are actually in the folder when you run this in the terminal or console)

`rails db:migrate`

## Additional Learning Resources
If you're interested, I have a YouTube channel, [@Deanin](https://youtube.com/deanin), where I've made a couple videos on Rails.

Additionally, I highly suggest learning to read the [Edge Guides](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/) because they are very well written, and often quite succint.
